# Intermediate-Game-Dev
These are scripts made in Intermediate Game Development Class at the University of New Haven, by Hugh-John Dunkley

In this game, the purpose is to demostrate being able to combine scripts and use them effectively. 

There is a menu that you can choose from in order to start or quit the game.

This game has the user navigate through an obstacle course. Throughout the course you must avoid the obstacles successfully or else you will have to restart from the beginning. By using tags and scene changes, it allows the user to restart the level 

There are also many different objects in the begnning. For example, certain objects move on their own by using physics, others change color, make a sound or grow on contact. 

There is occlusion culling in the project as well to help with rendering performance. Objects that are not seen by the player are not rendered until they are in the view of the player. 

At the end of the level, the player can collect spheres that increase their score. This score is also displayed by a slider. 

This projet uses multiple interfaces and managers to make coding and managing certain aspects of the game easier.
